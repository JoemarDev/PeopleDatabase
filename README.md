### People Database

Welcome to the README file!
This document will provide you with essential information about your project setup, scripts, design framework, state management, and its purpose.

### Project Overview

The project is a comprehensive people database designed to simplify the retrieval of essential information about individuals. It provides a user-friendly interface for effortlessly fetching a wide range of data related to people, making it an invaluable tool for various applications and scenarios. Explore the project to streamline your data retrieval needs and enhance your workflow.

### Scripts

The package.json file includes the following scripts to help you manage your project:

1. dev: Starts the development server using Vite.
2. build: Transpiles TypeScript files and builds the project for production.
3. lint: Lints your code using ESLint with configuration for TypeScript and TypeScript React files.
4. preview: Serves the production build for preview.
   You can run these scripts using npm run [script-name], for example, npm run dev to start the development server.

### Design Framework

This project utilizes Tailwind CSS for design. Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that makes it easy to design responsive and efficient web interfaces. You can customize the design by modifying the utility classes in your components.

### State Management

Context API is used for state management in this project. The Context API is a built-in feature of React that provides a way to share state across components without having to pass props explicitly at every level of the component tree.

To manage and update application-wide state, you can find the relevant context providers and consumers in the services/ directory.
